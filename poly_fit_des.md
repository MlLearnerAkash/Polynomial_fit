# Polynomial_fit


In this model , a ANN is used to fit the model with a polynomial equation of 3rd order .

Then it is being used to predict accordingly , to predict the corresponding y .

Lastly , the evaluation of the model :How the predicted output is being fitted with the acytual output . That has been shown graphically .
